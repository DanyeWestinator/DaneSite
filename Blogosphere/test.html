People who have no reliable bus route to work are not going to take the bus to work. Why would they, when the bus ticket costs the same as the gas to drive there? This is an entirely artificial problem, that can be solved in the short term by completely eliminating passenger fares from government run public transit. OCTA, in your home county, already subsidizes 90 cents out of every dollar it takes to run passengers. Why are we nickel and diming people over that last 10%? It would cost only $33 million a year to make all busses in Orange County completely free. If all of those busses were green, that&rsquo;s a lot of carbon not being spewed into the atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">This is the easiest and most glaringly obvious fix, but it cannot be the only one. Republicans have repeatedly shown that climate change is to be welcomed with open arms, and not a single one of their members have proposed any meaningful solutions to deal with it. This is an accepted fact, but why should it be? Why does every single Republican get a free pass for voting against climate change provisions, simply because they are expected to vote in the interests of Big Oil? The planet heating is not a partisan, or even solely American issue, and it will affect all of us more and more in the coming years. It was less than two years ago that the entire city had to be evacuated because of smoke billowing out from Silverado Canyon, but we insist on spending $2.5 billion to widen the 405 and 5, just to make it easier to drive places. That money could have bought many miles of green public transit, but instead, we continue to spew carbon from our tailpipes. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>The 2022 midterms are going to be a nasty fight, but the Republican party cannot be allowed to control the conversation. They need to be forced back on the defensive, to justify their inactions. Doing nothing about our environment is an active choice, a choice that will leave my grandchildren with polluted skies and burned homes. The clip that sold you to me as a politician was </span><span class="c6"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D0-VgyBP1EGg&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1643411620920432&amp;usg=AOvVaw1XwtTt8Ietwi7akhAISdsR">this one</a></span><span class="c3">, where you showed the absolute insanity that is our federal oil land leases. In the year 2022, America should not be drilling for new oil. The wells we have now will be enough to last us through the decarbonization process, but the air cannot afford that much new destruction. Fossil fuel companies will strip this country dry for an extra five dollars on the bottom line, but that has to end. 13.9 million acres of public land, just waiting to benefit an oil tycoon. Great. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">My only complaint with that line of questioning was that you didn&rsquo;t go far enough. We should take back every acre of land they aren&rsquo;t using, and tax their profits to make the largest national park in generations. If that sounds insane, just consider the alternative (What we are currently doing!) which is to continue to subsidize fossil fuels. We pay billions directly to these companies, instead of investing in clean energy. They need to pay their fair share for the carbon they emit, because the price the American people are paying has grown too high to bear. Just ask Paradise, California.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">People wouldn&rsquo;t need as much gasoline if there was a free Amtrak service to their destination. People wouldn&rsquo;t need as much gasoline if there were tax incentives to buy an ebike, and a safe and comfortable route to commute with it on. People wouldn&rsquo;t need as much gasoline if the bus service was consistent and frequent enough that you would never need to check a schedule. We can pollute our air less. All it takes is changing the conversation. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Democrats are losing because they have absolutely no idea how to talk to actual voters. Voters that really matter. Why would the Democratic party try hard to talk to Kevin McCarthy&rsquo;s deep-red conservatives, just because they&rsquo;d never vote for us? They aren&rsquo;t voting with us because we don&rsquo;t give them a reason to. Donald Trump was one of the most vile and course humans to ever ascend to the White House, but we cannot rest comfortably on him being gone forever, nor can we paint every Republican with the &ldquo;Trump&rdquo; brush to make them unappealing. Larry Elder was never going to win California, instead we need to be paying attention to Glenn Youngkin. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Pushing actual legislation that will actually help people is the only way to win voters hearts and minds. People care that getting to work is difficult, with too many red lights and a too-high gas bill. Solutions like good public transit would show that voting Blue has benefits, and not just to those scary illegals. Mark Cuban should not have to launch a website to connect people to cheap generic drugs, that is the job of the federal government. To say that democracy is at stake in 2022 is not an exaggeration. Another 2 years of Republican control-by-veto, followed by individual states gutting the right to vote, will cripple this country in a way that won&rsquo;t be easy to come back from. People see Nancy Pelosi getting richer off day trading in office, and then wonder why Trump was 70,000 votes shy of winning in 2020. Keep up the good work Katie, but don&rsquo;t let off a single ounce of pressure. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">More train letters to follow, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dane Carstens</span></p></body></html>'
