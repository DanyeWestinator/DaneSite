        <p>
            Save the Castle! is an innovative new tower defense that places you on the field of battle,
            in a level of immersion only VR can provide
        </p>
        <p>You can take over <i>any</i> tower on the battlefield, and turn the tide of the war</p>

            With a team of only two, I've had to wear many hats during development.
            <br /><br />&emsp;>Some features I've built include (but are not limited to!):
                  <ul>
                      <li>
                          Enemy state machine,
                          including ragdolls,
                          animation state machine, and
                          combat logic
                      </li>
                      <br />
                      <li>
                          Editor tools, including the terrain / prop generation,
                          path placement, and a wave creation wizard, to easily balance each level
                      </li>
                      <br />
                      <li>
                          Custom VR logic, including an automatic teleport floor placer, always keeping player comfort in mind
                      </li>

                  </ul>

        </p>

        <img src="{% static 'images/missile_gatling02.gif' %} " height="300" />
        <p>This game turned out more fun than I could have possibly imagined. Try it today!</p>

     <h2>SpaceRunners!</h2>
     <h3>>Senior thesis project: Spring Quarter 2022</h3>

     >>My senior thesis was a solo project in Godot, creating an android infinite runner<br />
     >>Everything, from programming to art, was done by me<br />
     <br />
     <<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mXzZsK1MvOIKCLFup6I_QwO0RVKjjsFe?usp=sharing">Playable builds</a>>
     <br />
     <br />
     >>Godot was chosen for two reasons:
     <br />
     >>>I agree with their open-source licensing on a moral level. Code is meant to be shared and improved by
     the entire community
     <br />
     >>>I wanted to train my adaptability, and learn a new system in a hands-on project.
     I had only ever used Unity until this point, and I wanted to experiment with a new language and engine
     <br />
     <iframe src="{% static 'images/SpaceRunners01.mp4' %}" width="180" height="400"></iframe><br />
     >>Systems I designed and built include:
     <br />
     >>>Turbo Boost, allowing the player to temporarily smash through asteroids and enemy Vipers
     <br />
     >>>Asteroids that destroy players, and explode on contact with lazers
     <br />
     >>>Lazers, to destroy foes and rocks
     <br />
     >>>Enemy ships, along with their AI
     <br />
     >>>Stat tracking, including kills, distance travelled,
     and number of times you bait an enemy into destroying an asteroid
     <br /><br /><br />
     >>One major advantage of creating a mobile game was it was much easier to find playtesters.
     <br />
     >>>I could hand over my phone, and get instant feedback
     <br />
     >>>This constant iteration made the game much more successful

         then the JSON files were parsed by my system

         <br />>>That context could include finding clues, or other conversations
