    <h3>>>Unity developer: June - October 2021, July - October 2022</h3>

As a developer, my tasks included:<br />
    >Building and implementing a multiplayer sandbox mode<br />
    >>Using the Mirror library for Unity, we ported all singe-player building features to a creative sandbox level,
    enabling friends to build and collaborate together
    <br /><br />

    >Creating a localization system<br />
    >>All text, from dialogue to item flavor, had to be scraped and added to a spreadsheet<br />
    >>Each line included the source of the text and a column for each language, including English<br />
    >>Once the CSV spreadsheet was translated, the correct language was displayed to the player<br /><br />

    >Building and maintaining QoL features<br />
    >>One feature automatically swapped to the next ingredient when constructing blueprints<br />
    >>A developer tool I built displayed all 3d models, sorted by vertex count.
    This massively increased performance after several problem areas were identified<br />
    >>On top of all my other tasks, we regularly cleared out the public buglist,
    fixing everything from pathfinding hiccups to texture glitches
    <br /><br />

The website itself is a portfolio piece!

This entire website was coded by me, using the django web framework. I hosted with the wonderful

<br />
I learned basic HTML for this project, inspired by the retro look webpages had in the early 2000s. I wanted to
minimized clutter, while making all relevant information as prominent as possible.
<br />
Every line of code was written by me, both front-end and backend

    I programmed an extensive dialogue tree system, which took in JSON files and created branching paths.
    <br />
    The backend dialogue trees were written using <a href="https://yarnspinner.dev/">yarnspinner</a>, then that data was
    fed into my custom Unity implementation.
    <br />

    <br />
    Other than speaking with witnesses, the primary way to gather evidence is to find clues around the crime scene.
    <br />
    This system integrated with my dialogue, and finding certain clues opens up hidden dialogue options.
    <br />
    The clue prefab itself was modular, and creating new ones was a simple drag and drop
    <br />
    <iframe src="{% static 'images/TwinRiversClueVid.mp4' %}" width="300" height="300"></iframe>
    <br />
    To assist in their fact finding, the player had access to important information said during conversation,
    as well as all their clues
    <br />
    There was also a map, which updated its position in real time as the player moved
