<h2>Education:</h2>
>>I will be graduating in June with a BS in Computer Game Science, with an emphasis on databases
<br />
>>My classes covered a broad array of computer science topics,
from networking to algorithm analysis to UI/UX design
<br />
>>Many classes were project based, building real world systems
<br />
>>I built AWS hosted web servers to practice SQL skills, along with countless games in Unity

    <h3>>Unity developer: June - October 2021, July - October 2022</h3>

>As a developer, my tasks included:<br />
    >>Building and implementing a multiplayer sandbox mode<br />
    >>>Using the Mirror library for Unity, we ported all singe-player building features to a creative sandbox level,
    enabling friends to build and collaborate together
    <br /><br />

    >>Creating a localization system<br />
    >>>All text, from dialogue to item flavor, had to be scraped and added to a spreadsheet<br />
    >>>Each line included the source of the text and a column for each language, including English<br />
    >>>Once the CSV spreadsheet was translated, the correct language was displayed to the player<br /><br />

    >>Building and maintaining QoL features<br />
    >>>One feature automatically swapped to the next ingredient when constructing blueprints<br />
    >>>A developer tool I built displayed all 3d models, sorted by vertex count.
    This massively increased performance after several problem areas were identified<br />
    >>>On top of all my other tasks, we regularly cleared out the public buglist,
    fixing everything from pathfinding hiccups to texture glitches
    <br /><br />


>From their steam page: <br />
    >>"Commonâ€™hood is a community building and economy management game with
    highly customizable base building tools. Scavenge for materials, grow your own food,
    research new technology, craft new tools, build a home, make friends.
    Form your community and take it from surviving to thriving!"

    <h3>>Senior thesis project: Spring Quarter 2022</h3>

    >>My senior thesis was a solo project in Godot, creating an android infinite runner<br />
    >>Everything, from programming to art, was done by me<br />
    <br />
    <<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mXzZsK1MvOIKCLFup6I_QwO0RVKjjsFe?usp=sharing"
>Playable builds</a>>
    <br />
    <br />
    >>Godot was chosen for two reasons:
    <br />
    >>>I agree with their open-source licensing on a moral level. Code is meant to be shared and improved by
    the entire community
    <br />
    >>>I wanted to train my adaptability, and learn a new system in a hands-on project.
    I had only ever used Unity until this point, and I wanted to experiment with a new language and engine
    <br />
    <iframe src="{% static 'images/SpaceRunners01.mp4' %}" width="180" height="400"></iframe><br />
    >>Systems I designed and built include:
    <br />
    >>>Turbo Boost, allowing the player to temporarily smash through asteroids and enemy Vipers
    <br />
    >>>Asteroids that destroy players, and explode on contact with lazers
    <br />
    >>>Lazers, to destroy foes and rocks
    <br />
    >>>Enemy ships, along with their AI
    <br />
    >>>Stat tracking, including kills, distance travelled,
    and number of times you bait an enemy into destroying an asteroid
    <br /><br /><br />
    >>One major advantage of creating a mobile game was it was much easier to find playtesters.
    <br />
    >>>I could hand over my phone, and get instant feedback
    <br />
    >>>This constant iteration made the game much more successful

    <h3>>Django based portfolio site: Winter Quarter 2022</h3>
>>My personal website itself is a portfolio piece!
<br />
>>This project was an exercise in full stack development
<br />
    >>The website was designed to be fast, lightweight, and portable across devices
<br />
    >>The design was chosen to minimize clutter, and have only the information on screen that the reader needed
<br />
>>Every line of code was written by me, both front-end and backend

    <h2>Twin Rivers, Montana</h2>
    <h3>>Solo Unity project: Summer-Fall 2020</h3>
<p >
    >My first large scale solo unity project
    <br />>I designed the game, programmed it, and wrote the story
    <br />
    <<a href="https://danecarstens.itch.io/twin-rivers">Play in browser!</a>>
    <br />
    <br />
    >The dialogue system is an entirely custom implementation
    <br />
    >Branching dialogue trees were written in <a href="https://yarnspinner.dev/">yarnspinner</a>,
    then the JSON files were parsed by my system
    <br />
    <br />>Some contextual lines needed previous game events to occur before the dialogue option appears
    <br />>>That context could include finding clues, or other conversations
    <br />>>This system allowed NPCs to respond directly to in-game events, increasing immersion and replayability
    <br /><br />>In addition, important details from conversations are added to the player's journal
    <br /><br />

    <iframe src="{% static 'images/TwinRiversConversations.mp4' %}" width="300" height="300"></iframe>
    <br /><br />
    >Another major system I built was the clues
    <br />
    >>Scattered throughout the map are interactable clues.
    <br />
    >>After a clue is picked up, it is added to the player's journal
    <br />
    >>Creating new clues was a simple drag and drop
    <br />
    <iframe src="{% static 'images/TwinRiversClueVid.mp4' %}" width="300" height="300"></iframe>
    <br />

    >I also created a map that tracked the player's location in real time
