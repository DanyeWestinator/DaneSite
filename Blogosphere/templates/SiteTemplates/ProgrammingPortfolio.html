<h2>Education:</h2>
>>I will be graduating in June with a BS in Computer Game Science, with an emphasis on databases
<br />
>>My classes covered a broad array of computer science topics,
from networking to algorithm analysis to UI/UX design
<br />
>>Many classes were project based, building real world systems
<br />
>>I built AWS hosted web servers to practice SQL skills, along with countless games in Unity

    <h3>>>Unity developer: June - October 2021, July - October 2022</h3>

As a developer, my tasks included:<br />
    >Building and implementing a multiplayer sandbox mode<br />
    >>Using the Mirror library for Unity, we ported all singe-player building features to a creative sandbox level,
    enabling friends to build and collaborate together
    <br /><br />

    >Creating a localization system<br />
    >>All text, from dialogue to item flavor, had to be scraped and added to a spreadsheet<br />
    >>Each line included the source of the text and a column for each language, including English<br />
    >>Once the CSV spreadsheet was translated, the correct language was displayed to the player<br /><br />

    >Building and maintaining QoL features<br />
    >>One feature automatically swapped to the next ingredient when constructing blueprints<br />
    >>A developer tool I built displayed all 3d models, sorted by vertex count.
    This massively increased performance after several problem areas were identified<br />
    >>On top of all my other tasks, we regularly cleared out the public buglist,
    fixing everything from pathfinding hiccups to texture glitches
    <br /><br />

    <h3>>>Senior thesis project: Spring Quarter 2022</h3>

    >>My senior thesis was a solo project in Godot, creating an android infinite runner<br />
    >>Everything, from programming to art, was done by me<br />
    <br />

    <br />
    <br />
    >>Godot was chosen for two reasons:
    <br />
    >>>I agree with their open-source licensing on a moral level. Code is meant to be shared and improved by
    the entire community
    <br />
    >>>I wanted to train my adaptability, and learn a new system in a hands-on project.
    I had only ever used Unity until this point, and I wanted to experiment with a new language and engine
    <br />
    <iframe src="{% static 'images/SpaceRunners01.mp4' %}" width="180" height="400"></iframe><br />
    >>Systems I designed and built include:
    <br />
    >>>Turbo Boost, allowing the player to temporarily smash through asteroids and enemy Vipers
    <br />
    >>>Asteroids that destroy players, and explode on contact with lazers
    <br />
    >>>Lazers, to destroy foes and rocks
    <br />
    >>>Enemy ships, along with their AI
    <br />
    >>>Stat tracking, including kills, distance travelled,
    and number of times you bait an enemy into destroying an asteroid
    <br /><br /><br />
    >>One major advantage of creating a mobile game was it was much easier to find playtesters.
    <br />
    >>>I could hand over my phone, and get instant feedback
    <br />
    >>>This constant iteration made the game much more successful

    <br />
    I programmed an extensive dialogue tree system, which took in JSON files and created branching paths.
    <br />
    The backend dialogue trees were written using <a href="https://yarnspinner.dev/">yarnspinner</a>, then that data was
    fed into my custom Unity implementation.
    <br />
    <br />

    <br />
    Other than speaking with witnesses, the primary way to gather evidence is to find clues around the crime scene.
    <br />
    This system integrated with my dialogue, and finding certain clues opens up hidden dialogue options.
    <br />
    The clue prefab itself was modular, and creating new ones was a simple drag and drop
    <br />
    <iframe src="{% static 'images/TwinRiversClueVid.mp4' %}" width="300" height="300"></iframe>
    <br />
    To assist in their fact finding, the player had access to important information said during conversation,
    as well as all their clues
    <br />
    There was also a map, which updated its position in real time as the player moved
    <br />
