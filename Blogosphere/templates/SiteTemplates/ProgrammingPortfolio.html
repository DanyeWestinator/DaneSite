<br />
I learned basic HTML for this project, inspired by the retro look webpages had in the early 2000s. I wanted to
minimized clutter, while making all relevant information as prominent as possible.
<br />
Every line of code was written by me, both front-end and backend

&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a full time developer for the summer and fall of 2021. I worked on bug fixes, adding developer tools,
and prototyping the online multi-player. The game was built in the Unity engine.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my more important tasks was creating the localization system. I had to scrape all text from the game, and export
it to an Excel file. It had columns for the english text, and space for the translator to put translated text.
With one click, the writing team could export all text in the game, and just as easily update the translated text.
In game, the user could select the different languages, and the game shifted languages.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the online multi-player, we used the Mirror library for unity.
<br />
The game is set to come out in Fall 2022

    I programmed an extensive dialogue tree system, which took in JSON files and created branching paths.
    <br />
    The backend dialogue trees were written using <a href="https://yarnspinner.dev/">yarnspinner</a>, then that data was
    fed into my custom Unity implementation.
    <br />

    <br />
    Other than speaking with witnesses, the primary way to gather evidence is to find clues around the crime scene.
    <br />
    This system integrated with my dialogue, and finding certain clues opens up hidden dialogue options.
    <br />
    The clue prefab itself was modular, and creating new ones was a simple drag and drop
    <br />
    <iframe src="{% static 'images/TwinRiversClueVid.mp4' %}" width="300" height="300"></iframe>
    <br />
    To assist in their fact finding, the player had access to important information said during conversation,
    as well as all their clues
    <br />
    There was also a map, which updated its position in real time as the player moved
